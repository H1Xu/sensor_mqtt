# Home Assistant ThermIQ-MQTT Integration
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

This integration allows you to use the ThermIQ-MQTT hardware interface to control and monitor your Thermia or Danfoss heatpump from Home Assistant. It is available as a default component of HACS, the Home Assistant Community Store.

Some info background information on the ThermIQ-MQTT interface can be found here:
https://thermiq.net

**This integration will evolve over time**
Please not that in Release 1.0.0 the thermiq_automations.yaml and lovelace.yaml has changed and you need to update your automation.yaml and UI accordingly.

## Requirements

- MQTT server and the MQTT integration set up in Home Assistant
- ThermIQ-MQTT interface installed in your heatpump and properly configured to communicate over MQTT

- A couple of Lovelace plugins

## Quick start
1. Make sure that ThermIQ is properly setup and communicating with the MQTT server
2. Make sure that MQTT Integration in Home Assistant is setup and communicating with the MQTT server
3. Make sure you have HACS set-up (https://github.com/custom-components/hacs).
4. Go to the HACS integrations page, add ThermIQ integration.

## Configuration
#### Component Configuration:
The complete configuration entry can be found in [configuration_thermiq.yaml](https://github.com/ThermIQ/thermiq_mqtt-ha/blob/master/configuration_thermiq.yaml) and should be copied to your configuration.yaml file.

```yaml
# Begin ThermIQ #####
# ThermIQ-MQTT configuration.yaml entry
# Set the mqtt_node name here. Thats all!
thermiq_mqtt:
  mqtt_node: ThermIQ/ThermIQ-mqtt
  #thermiq_dbg: True


#Input entities for ThermIQ -> configuration.yaml
input_number:
  thermiq_rum_bor2:
    name: 'Indoor target temp.'
    initial: 0
    min:  0
    max:  50
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: 'ÂºC'
    icon: 'mdi:temperature-celsius'
    mode: slider

  thermiq_kurva:
    name: 'Curve'
    initial: 0
    min:  0
    max:  200
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: ''
    icon: 'mdi:speedometer'
    mode: box

   
```

#### Automations configuration
A complete automation between frontend input entities to the backend control is included in [automations_thermiq.yaml](https://github.com/ThermIQ/thermiq_mqtt-ha/blob/master/automations_thermiq.yaml) and should be copied to your automations.yaml file.


#### Lovelace Configuration:
The file [lovelace_config.yaml](https://github.com/ThermIQ/thermiq_mqtt-ha/blob/master/lovelace_config.yaml) contains a complete setup of all available variables. A short example could look like:

```yaml
# ################################################
# ##### ThermIQ Lovelace config. Add in Raw configuration editor
      - type: entities
        title: ThermIQ
        theme: default
        show_header_toggle: false
        entities:
          - entity: thermiq_mqtt.last_msg_time
          - entity: input_select.thermiq_dl
          
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_ute
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_rum_ar
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_rum_bor
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_fram
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_retur
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_vatten
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_brine_ut
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_brine_in
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_kylning
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_fram_shunt
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_stromforbr
          - type: 'custom:text-divider-row'
            text: ts_1
          - entity: binary_sensor.thermiq_ts_1
          - entity: binary_sensor.thermiq_ts_2
          - type: 'custom:text-divider-row'
            text: ^
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_fram_bor
          - entity: sensor.thermiq_t_fram_shunt_bor
```

The lovelace setup requires the following custom card to be installed in HACS
```
- text-divider-row


```

#### Restart
The Home Assistant server needs to be restarted once all configuration is done

## Features and Limitations
- Currently provides all data from the heatpump in the form of sensors and binary sensors
- Allows control over the heatpump 

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, feel free to pick up anything on the current [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ThermIQ/thermiq_mqtt-ha/issues) list!
Also, help making a nice lovelace card would be great!
